Forked Cork Boolean Library

Original Licensing
=========

Cork is licensed under the LGPL with an exception (from QT) to more easily allow use of template code.  In plain English, the following are some guidelines on the use of this code:

*  Unless you also intend to release your project under LGPL/GPL, you must make sure to DYNAMICALLY link against the Cork library.  However, you may include unmodified header files without compromising your proprietary code.

*  If you distribute your code, (publicly or privately, compiled or in source form, for free or commercially) you must (a) acknowledge your use of Cork, (b) include the COPYRIGHT information and (c) either distribute the Cork code or clearly indicate where a copy may be found.

Of course, none of the above supercedes the actual COPYRIGHT.
